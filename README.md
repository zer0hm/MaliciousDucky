# MaliciousDucky
This is a for "fun" project which I worked on back in 2017 to familiarize myself with microcontrollers. The urge to create this was due to how absurdly expensive HAK5's Rubber Ducky is, given how cheap the hardware it runs on. I have added few more imporvements to make it versatile such as implementing an SD card to store mutiple scripts and a 4-bit DIP switch to allow the user to pick a certain script.

Bill of Materials:
1x Cheap Chinese Arduino Pro Mini (Running a XXXX microcontroller) - $2.20.
1x Cheapest 4-bit DIP switches you can ever find - $0.10.
4x 1k+ resistors to act as pull down resistor - literally worhtless. 
1x MicrorSD card reader module running on SPI - 0.40.
1x Micro USB OTG (Male to Male) - 0.10.
